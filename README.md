# karting-archive
An emulated game server for LittleBigPlanet™Karting and ModNation®Racers on the PS3®. Look at the `www` (public server directory) folder for documentation about the server and files. This project is made for the PHP7+ programming language running on Apache 2.4+.

## Notice
This is an archive repo of DeltaFlush/karting, based on what could be downloaded [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20190701182814/https://codeload.github.com/DeltaFlush/karting/zip/master). It's outdated with it being an archive from 1st July 2019, but until the original can be uploaded to GitHub again or shared to others, this will be a base for further progress.

## How to Connect
All types of PS3 systems will be able to connect (regardless if it's CEX, DEX, CFW, HAN, HEN). The server is in its prototype phase therefore instructions will be made once it's actually playable and ready to be publicly tested.
